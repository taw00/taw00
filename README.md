#### Agrarius digeratus literatus: *I farm. I tech. I write.*

I'm retired from the tech industry and now run a small farm in the US Piedmont while sometimes helping folks buy and sell real estate. My primary passion, though, is writing. Tech and writing converge a bit with these small projects I maintain:

- [Manuscript Formatting (CSS) of Markdown for Writers](https://github.com/taw00/manuscript-css) - Prefer to write in a markdown editor? Here're some tools to present your work in [industry standard manuscript format](https://format.ms/story) without leaving your favorite editor.
- [Writing Resources](https://github.com/taw00/writing-resources) - My dumping ground for open-source writing resources. It's very dated.

You can discover more about me via [[my keybase profile](https://keybase.io/toddwarner)] and then hit me up with some [[coffee](https://buymeacoff.ee/toddwarner)].
