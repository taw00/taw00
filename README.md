#### Agrarius digeratus literatus: *I farm. I tech. I write.*

I'm retired from the tech industry and now run a small farm in the US Piedmont while sometimes helping folks buy and sell real estate. My primary passion, though, is writing. Tech and writing converge a bit with these small projects I maintain. Here's the most interesting of them:

- [[manuscript-css]](https://github.com/taw00/manuscript-css)  
  **Write your Manuscript in Markdown or HTML â€” *for Creative Writers***  
  Prefer to do all of your writing in a text or markdown editor? You can now produce an [industry standard manuscript format](https://format.ms/story) without leaving your favorite editor.

<!--
- [[Writing Resources (very dated)]](https://github.com/taw00/writing-resources)  
  My dumping ground for open-source writing resources.
